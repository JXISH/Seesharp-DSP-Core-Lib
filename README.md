# Seesharp-DSP-Core-Lib
JXI C# DSP-Core Library

It provides advanced analysis (signal processing) tools for C# programmers.

It is an image of our works, now is in beta. Documents included, and you can ask questions on CSDN under posted BLOG with keyword “Seesharp DSP-Core”.

Questions and recommendations can send to dsp@jxinst.com. But may not get answer. Valuable answers may be posted on CSDN blog.

You are on your own risk if you use this work. You can use this work free of charge and build library by yourself.  Then you can use your built library for any commercial works.

If you debug or improved my library, you must make it open-source too. Under LGPL v3 license, as that of this work.
